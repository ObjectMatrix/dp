### Divide and conquer:  

Recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type. 

### Dynamic programming:
Breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems. Example: Tower of Hanoi puzzle 

### Greedy algorithm: 
The problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. Example: traveling salesman problem Backtracking : is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems Example: Sudoku puzzle solved by backtracking. 

### Brute Force:
A very general problem-solving technique that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
